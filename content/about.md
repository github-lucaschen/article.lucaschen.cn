It's been a long time since I bought a server and domain name, and I'm taking advantage of this New Year to learn about [nginx](http://nginx.org/) and how to do service forwarding. Cooperate with [Hugo](http://www.gohugo.io/) to generate a static web page, which uses the theme of [archie](https://github.com/archie/archie) to build a personal website.

The plan here is to store configuration files and organize notes.

Personally, I prefer to organize and store things I see on the Internet. Originally, it was for personal review, so I did not mark the information of the original author. Now put it on the website and I'll try to find out where it came from and identify it.

If the notes are collated and learned from others, the [reprint](/tags/reprint/) identifier will be added at the first of the [tag](/tags/), and the original author information will be provided at the beginning of the article.

If the original is not found, the [unknown](/tags/unknown/) identifier will be added after [reprint](/tags/reprint/) in [tag](/tags/reprint/), and it will be noted at the beginning of the article that it is reprinted, not original.

Use all articles website ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)) protocol management, can be reprint, but need to indicate the author and link address.

If you have any questions, such as reprinting your article, but not marking, please feel free to contact me.
